Display the patient ID and create a new column that calculates how much each patient still needs to pay. Call the new column payment_remaining.

SELECT patient_id
, procedure_bill - payment_received AS payment_remaining
FROM billing;

Select every patient ID, the procedure bill, and create a new column that calculates the fraction of what the patient has paid toward their procedure bill. 
Call the new column payment_fraction and sort it from low to high.

SELECT patient_id
, procedure_bill
, payment_received / procedure_bill AS payment_fraction
FROM billing
ORDER BY payment_fraction;


Display the patient ID, payment_fraction (copy from the previous query),
and add a column displaying the percent of the bill that the patient has paid, rounded to one place. 
Call the new column payment_percent.

SELECT patient_id
, payment_received / procedure_bill AS payment_fraction
, ROUND((payment_received / procedure_bill)*100, 1) AS payment_percent
FROM billing;


Using a CASE expression will enable us to create categories
If someone has paid 100% of their bill, write "paid"
If someone has paid 0%, write “no payment”
If it’s something else (a value between 0 and 100), write “in progress”
name the column payment_status

SELECT patient_id
, payment_received / procedure_bill AS payment_fraction
, CASE
WHEN (payment_received / procedure_bill) = 1 THEN "paid"
WHEN (payment_received / procedure_bill) = 0 THEN "no payment"
ELSE "in progress"
END AS payment_status
FROM billing
;


Alter the previous query to create more categories in payment_status.

If someone has paid 100% of their bill, write "paid"
if someone has paid 0%, write “no payment”
If the patient has paid 75% or more, write "75%+".
Do the same for 50% and 25%
If the number is under 25%, write "Under 25%"
name the column payment_status


SELECT patient_id
, payment_received / procedure_bill
, CASE
WHEN (payment_received / procedure_bill) = 1 THEN "paid"
WHEN (payment_received / procedure_bill) = 0 THEN "no payment"
WHEN (payment_received / procedure_bill) >= .75 THEN "75%+"
WHEN (payment_received / procedure_bill) >= .5 THEN "50%+"
WHEN (payment_received / procedure_bill) >= .25 THEN "25%+"
ELSE "Under 25%"
END AS payment_status
FROM billing
;
