Welcome to my SQL portfolio!

This is where I store all the SQL queries and projects I create as I learn and practice data analysis.
You will find examples covering different skills â€” from sorting and filtering data to calculating statistics and answering real-world questions using databases.
I am building this portfolio as part of my learning journey, and I will keep adding new work as I grow my SQL skills.
